Overview
---
In this project, I used what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. trained and validated a model so it could classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, I tried out the model on images of German traffic signs that I found on the web.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project were the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
